                    <p> 
                        This map posed the greatest design challenge to me yet from a design standpoint. The map showcases the beauty of the lower part of the Crown of the Continent, 
                        an area of over one million acres of preserved wilderness. I went into the map knowing that I wanted to do something similar to Daniel Coe’s Glacial Landforms of the Puget Lowland beautiful map that appears in a volume of NACIS’s Atlas of Design. 
                        I loved the look of his map because the glacier/icy area caught my eye with its stunning hyper-realism. </p>
                        <p> As I began to play around with the map, I decided that I wanted the map to be an idealized version of the area in the wintertime with a much larger glacial extent than the small glaciers that linger today. 
                        To do this, I spent a lot of time in adobe photoshop playing around with effects to make the highest elevation areas look like ice. 
                        The result was a gorgeous blending of ice into the landscape. Balancing the color was another challenge. 
                        The ice in my first iterations of the design rose to the figure too much as they had a stark difference from the rest of the landscape. 
                        So, I messed around with a color ramp that ended up with 10 levels with varying colors to achieve an eye-pleasing aesthetic. 
                        The colors do not depict actual land cover; rather, they were chosen by me to create an idealized picturesque view of the area. </p>
                    <p>Once I started labeling features, I got lost in the world of typography. I spent hours testing out different typefaces. 
                        I am thankful for the advice that Tanya Buckingham and Daniel Huffman gave me. 
                        I was deadest on a serif typeface, but they told me that it would be better in this case to use a sans-serif typeface as the map colors were saturated, and the complexity of the map is high with the hillshade and tree cover. 
                    </p>
                    <p> After spending two years around Daniel Huffman, I knew that I had to learn the application called blender that allows for a more pleasing hillshade to be generated compared to usual GIS programs. 
                        With the help of photoshop expert Tanya Buckingham and photoshop/blender expert Daniel, I became comfortable in blender and photoshop. 
                        Even more, I went beyond their tips and tricks and challenged myself to follow some tutorials online to get the ice effect to how I wanted it to be. 
                        In return, I gained confidence and proficiency in my blender and photoshop abilities. I cannot recommend Daniel's <a class='link' href='https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/tutorials/' target="blank">tutorials</a> 
                        including the <a class="link" href='https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/2017/11/16/creating-shaded-relief-in-blender/' target="blank">blender tutorial </a> enough.
